# Galaxy Strike

A simple rail shooter game made in Unity.

Aim and shoot using your mouse.
Destroy enemies before they damage you
Dodge obstacles and survive to the end of each level

PS: The graphics may appear lower quality in the web build due to WebGL limitations. For the best experience, please run the game locally on your computer â€” visuals look significantly better when played natively.
